# Pocket Maths
An iOS app with mathematics lectures for high school, exercises, exam tests and utilities (in italian). Bring your maths with you!

## A Bit of History
We developed this app in the late 2013, during the last year of high school at Liceo Scientifico G. Castelnuovo in Florence. Professor F. Parigi gave us the possibility to use his material with no limitations,and helped us developing some of the utilities.
It has been a really educational project, that gave us the possibility to give some "lectures" to other students and professors and to have two interviews with two local journals.
We also created a startup with the fancy name "SB AppStudios".

## Getting Started
At the moment, the app is no longer supported. In order to launch the application, just open the Xcode project file in the Project folder and select a compatible deployment target.

## Issues
The app was test with iOS 8 the last time. There might be some issues due to misplaced views in iPhone > 5S. 

## Screenshots
These are presentation screenshots of the application when it was on the App Store.
